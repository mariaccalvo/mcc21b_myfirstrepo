# **Cluster Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms**

## **1. Introduction to Cluster Analysis**
   - **Definition:** Cluster analysis groups data into meaningful or useful clusters based on similarities.
   - **Purpose:**
     - Understanding: Clusters as conceptually meaningful groups.
     - Utility: Clusters as a way to summarize and process data.
   - **Applications:**
     - **Biology:** Genetic analysis, taxonomies of living organisms.
     - **Information Retrieval:** Grouping search results.
     - **Climate Science:** Identifying atmospheric patterns.
     - **Psychology & Medicine:** Classifying diseases or mental disorders.
     - **Business:** Customer segmentation.

## **2. What Is a Cluster?**
   - **Definition:** A group of objects that are similar within the group and dissimilar to objects in other groups.
   - **Challenges in Defining Clusters:**
     - Clusters may have different shapes, sizes, and densities.
     - Visual perception may influence cluster interpretation.

## **3. Types of Clustering**
   - **Hierarchical vs. Partitional**
     - *Hierarchical Clustering:* Forms nested clusters (e.g., tree structures).
     - *Partitional Clustering:* Divides data into non-overlapping clusters.
   - **Exclusive vs. Overlapping vs. Fuzzy**
     - *Exclusive:* Each object belongs to only one cluster.
     - *Overlapping:* Objects can belong to multiple clusters.
     - *Fuzzy:* Objects have degrees of membership in multiple clusters.
   - **Complete vs. Partial**
     - *Complete:* Every object is assigned to a cluster.
     - *Partial:* Some objects remain unclustered (e.g., outliers).

## **4. Types of Clusters**
   - **Well-Separated Clusters:** Objects in one cluster are more similar to each other than to objects in other clusters.
     - *Example:* Two distinct groups of data points in 2D space.
   - **Prototype-Based Clusters:** Each cluster is represented by a prototype (e.g., centroid or medoid).
     - *Example:* K-means clustering.
   - **Graph-Based Clusters:** Clusters based on connectivity (e.g., contiguity-based clusters).
     - *Example:* Single-link hierarchical clustering.
   - **Density-Based Clusters:** High-density regions separated by low-density regions.
     - *Example:* DBSCAN.
   - **Shared-Property Clusters (Conceptual Clustering):** Objects share a common property.
     - *Example:* Objects grouped by shape rather than proximity.

# **Clustering Algorithms**

## **5. K-Means Clustering**
   - **Definition:** A prototype-based, partitional clustering method.
   - **Algorithm:**
     1. Select K initial centroids.
     2. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
     3. Recompute the centroid of each cluster.
     4. Repeat until centroids do not change.
   - **Key Considerations:**
     - Choosing the initial centroids can affect the final result.
     - Sensitive to outliers and non-globular clusters.
   - **Example:**
     - Given points in a 2D space, K-means iteratively adjusts centroids to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE).

## **6. Bisecting K-Means**
   - **Definition:** A hierarchical variant of K-means that splits clusters iteratively.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Start with all data in one cluster.
     2. Split the cluster into two using K-means.
     3. Repeat on the largest cluster until K clusters are obtained.
   - **Advantage:** Less sensitive to initialization problems.

## **7. Hierarchical Clustering**
   - **Agglomerative Approach:** Bottom-up approach where clusters are merged iteratively.
   - **Divisive Approach:** Top-down approach where clusters are split recursively.
   - **Dendrogram:** A tree-like representation of clusters.
   - **Types of Linkage Criteria:**
     - **Single Link (MIN):** Clusters are merged based on the closest points.
     - **Complete Link (MAX):** Clusters are merged based on the farthest points.
     - **Group Average:** Clusters are merged based on the average similarity of all points.

## **8. Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN)**
   - **Definition:** Clusters are formed in dense regions, ignoring noise.
   - **Key Parameters:**
     - ε (epsilon): Neighborhood radius.
     - MinPts: Minimum points required to form a dense region.
   - **Strengths:**
     - Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.
     - Resistant to outliers.
   - **Example:** Detecting human activity clusters in GPS data.

## **9. Cluster Validation**
   - **Internal Validity Measures:**
     - Sum of Squared Errors (SSE).
     - Silhouette Score.
   - **External Validity Measures:**
     - Comparison with ground truth labels.

# *Homework*
Here’s a detailed outline of your quiz topics based on Homework Problem Set 3: Basic Clustering.

# **Quiz Outline: Basic Clustering Concepts**

## **1. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering vs. K-Means**
   - **Definition**:
     - *Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering*: Bottom-up approach where each data point starts as its own cluster and merges iteratively.
     - *K-Means Clustering*: Partition-based method that minimizes within-cluster variance by updating centroids iteratively.
   - **Comparison**:
     - *Outlier Handling*: Hierarchical clustering is more robust to outliers since it does not force assignments like K-Means.
     - *Consistency of Results*: Hierarchical clustering always produces the same clusters, whereas K-Means can yield different results due to random initialization.
     - *Efficiency*: K-Means is generally more efficient in terms of time and memory compared to hierarchical clustering.
   - **Example**:
     - Single-link vs. complete-link clustering differences in merging strategies.

## **2. K-Means Algorithm Concepts**
   - **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**
     - Measures intra-cluster cohesion (how compact the clusters are).
     - Formula: \( SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2 \)
   - **Between Sum of Squares (SSB)**
     - Measures inter-cluster separation.
     - Formula: \( SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i ||\mu_i - \mu||^2 \)
   - **Relationship Between SSE and SSB**:
     - \( \text{Total Variance} = SSE + SSB \) is constant.
   - **Effects of Re-splitting Clusters**:
     - Example: If a cluster is split by selecting a new centroid, SSE will decrease due to better cohesion.

## **3. K-Means Convergence Behavior**
   - **Impact of Initialization**:
     - Poor initialization can lead to empty clusters.
     - Different initializations can lead to different final clusters.
   - **Cluster Distribution in Different Scenarios**:
     - Given figures showing different cluster distributions, predict how K-Means will distribute centroids.

## **4. SSE Computation**
   - **Given a Set of Points and a Centroid**:
     - Compute SSE for given clusters.
     - Example: Points arranged in a circle around centroid C.
   - **Effect of Changing Centroids**:
     - Compute SSE for a new centroid location.

## **5. K-Means with Unequal Cluster Sizes**
   - **Centroid Allocation in Imbalanced Clusters**:
     - Scenario: Three clusters (A, B, and C) with different densities and distances.
     - Predict how many centroids will be assigned to each.

## **6. Agglomerative Clustering Merging Criteria**
   - **Single-Link (MIN) vs. Complete-Link (MAX)**
     - *Single-Link*: Merge clusters with the closest points.
     - *Complete-Link*: Merge clusters where the farthest points are closest.
   - **Example**:
     - Given three clusters, determine which should merge first under each method.

## **7. DBSCAN Clustering**
   - **Density-Based Clustering Concepts**:
     - Core points: Have at least `MinPts` within `ε` radius.
     - Boundary points: Fewer than `MinPts` but in the neighborhood of a core point.
     - Noise: Points that are neither core nor boundary.
   - **Effects of Changing Parameters (`ε` and `MinPts`)**:
     - Given two different values of `ε`, label core/boundary/noise points.

## **8. Evaluating Clustering with Entropy**
   - **Clustering Entropy Calculation**:
     - Measures impurity of clusters.
     - High entropy means clusters contain mixed data classes.
   - **Example**:
     - Given a confusion matrix for land classification, identify the cluster with the highest/lowest entropy.

## **9. Distance Matrices and Cluster Matching**
   - **Interpreting Distance Matrices**:
     - Diagonal elements represent intra-cluster compactness.
     - Off-diagonal elements represent inter-cluster distances.
   - **Example**:
     - Given three distance matrices, match them to the correct clustering dataset.

## **10. Choosing the Right Clustering Method**
   - **Partitional vs. Hierarchical Clustering**
     - Partitional: Unnested, exclusive (e.g., K-Means).
     - Hierarchical: Nested, can be overlapping (e.g., dendrograms).
   - **Complete vs. Partial Clustering**:
     - Complete: Every data point is assigned a cluster.
     - Partial: Some data points remain unclustered.
   - **Example Scenarios**:
     - Clustering proteins with hierarchical taxonomy.
     - Grouping students by their job assignments (overlapping constraint).

## **11. Clustering Faces Using DBSCAN vs. K-Means**
   - **DBSCAN for Face Clustering**:
     - Can detect eyes, nose, mouth due to density-based clustering.
   - **K-Means for Face Clustering**:
     - Struggles if features are not clearly separable in Euclidean space.
   - **Alternative Methods**:
     - Spectral clustering or deep learning-based methods.
